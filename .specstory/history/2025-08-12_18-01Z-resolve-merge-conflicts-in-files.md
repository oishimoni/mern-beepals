I can see you have multiple merge conflicts across several files. Let me resolve these conflicts systematically by examining each file and choosing the appropriate version based on the context.

Let me start by resolving the conflicts in the user model file:

<details><summary>Edit file: backend/models/user.model.js</summary>

I will resolve the merge conflicts by keeping the HEAD version which includes password hashing functionality and both email and username fields.

Now let me resolve the conflicts in the profile routes file. I'll keep the HEAD version which contains the proper Express.js backend routes:
